This Project is created using React and css classes, I have used various react hooks like useState, useContext, useNavigate, CreateContext, useEffect. I have utilized react-router-dom package to handle our routes and bring connectivity. 

This food Website supports many features like Search, Login, and its full dynamic and responsive in all screen sizes.

I have used Vite + React framework for the project.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
